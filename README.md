This project has been migrated from my google code svn. Here I share the coding exercises and libraries I write on my own to solve coding contest.

Don't take any of this at face value. I'm  practicing coding and sometimes I make horrible things on purpose (supposedly :P).

Key shortcuts:
  cmd + shift + e: toggles focus terminal / editor.
